MarkdStage is an open-source presentation tool that turns Markdown directly into polished slides,
with editing, synchronized presenting, speaker notes, PDF export, and PowerPoint export that keeps
text, tables, code, and diagrams editable. Its native GitHub Copilot canvas Extension, standalone
Windows app, and command-line interface share one renderer, so authors can keep Markdown as
the source of truth from the first draft to the stage.

## Why MarkdStage

- **Markdown is the source**: Keep `.md` as the source of truth instead of moving to a proprietary format
- **Write, then present immediately**: Open a file in the canvas or Desktop and it becomes a slide deck
- **Present technical content directly**: Supports code, Mermaid, Architecture DSL, images, tables, and speaker notes
- **Keep output consistent**: Use the same renderer in the canvas, presentation window, Desktop, PDF, and PowerPoint export, with fenced code remaining editable in PowerPoint
- **Validate PDF fit before export**: Preview the fixed 16:9 layout, inspect clipping, and capture only pages that need visual review
- **Keep controls focused on presenting**: Navigate with buttons, the keyboard, or Surface Pen in supported environments

### Choose the diagram format

Use Mermaid when the diagram should be generated from its relationships and laid out automatically.
Use Architecture DSL when the diagram is part of the slide design and its positions, sizes, groups,
icons, connectors, or theme treatment need to remain intentional and stable. Both formats can follow
the deck theme, but they solve different authoring problems.

MarkdStage is different because the Markdown file remains the source of truth through authoring,
presentation, layout review, PDF export, and editable PowerPoint export. The same renderer carries
the deck across those stages, so a diagram is not only something to display: it can remain part of
the source, be edited visually, and be carried into the final deliverable.

## See Markdown on stage

The same Markdown renderer powers the GitHub Copilot canvas, presenter window, Desktop app, CLI, PDF
export, and editable PowerPoint export.

      Write headings, lists, emphasis, code, tables, and images directly. Mermaid is also available
      when automatic diagram layout is useful.

    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Architecture DSL</strong><br>
      Put JSON in an <code>architecture</code> fence for stable groups, icons, placement, and
      connector routing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Because the MarkdStage canvas contributes the active deck and Architecture DSL to the GitHub
Copilot App context, you can describe the diagram you want and ask Copilot to write or revise the
Markdown for you.

For visual changes, use **More controls > Open Markdown**, choose **More controls > Shape editing >
Advanced editing**, and use the dedicated Architecture Editor. It can add, remove, arrange, and
inspect nodes, groups, images, and connectors; changes remain a draft until **Save** writes them
back to Markdown.

## Ways to use MarkdStage

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **MarkdStage canvas** | Ask GitHub Copilot to summarize and format Markdown, or load it directly with **More controls > Open Markdown** |
| **MarkdStage Desktop** | Present on Windows while viewing the Markdown, next slide, and speaker notes without opening GitHub Copilot |
| **MarkdStage CLI** | Present, validate, capture, and export from a terminal, CI, Codex, or Claude Code without the canvas |
| **MarkStageForMac** (third-party) | Present on macOS with the community-built native app. Developed and supported outside this repository |

## Use the canvas Extension

When you open this repository as a project, `.github/extensions/markdstage/` loads at project
scope. To install the current **[v3.2.0 release](https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/releases/tag/v3.2.0)**
at user scope in another repository, ask GitHub Copilot:

> Install MarkdStage at user scope from the following GitHub repository folder.
>
> `https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/tree/v3.2.0/.github/extensions/markdstage`

The Extension runs local code in the user's environment. Review its contents before installation,
and use a trusted release tag or commit SHA for a reproducible install. The `main` branch tracks
the latest development version.

### Minimal workflow

1. Edit `slides.md` and separate slides with `---` after a blank line.
2. Ask Copilot, "Present this deck using `slides.md`."
3. Navigate with **◀ ▶**, the **arrow keys**, or the **☰ slide list** in the MarkdStage canvas.
4. Use **More controls > Output preview** before PDF or PowerPoint export. Copilot can run `inspect_layout` first and generate selected PNG previews only when needed.

You can also open Markdown directly from the workspace with **More controls > Open Markdown** or
the `I` key, without using AI. In a Git repository, the workspace is the repository root;
otherwise it is the folder opened for the current session. When calling `open_canvas` directly,
use canvas ID **`MarkdStage`**.

```text
canvasId: MarkdStage
```

## Use MarkdStage Desktop

[MarkdStage Desktop](./apps/MarkdStage.Desktop/README.md) is a WinUI 3 app that opens Markdown
from a file picker. It displays the current and next slides with the current slide's speaker notes,
and launches a synchronized native presentation window.

The current **[v3.2.0 release](https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/releases/tag/v3.2.0)**
includes portable builds and SHA-256 checksum files for Windows x64 and ARM64:

- [MarkdStage-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/releases/download/v3.2.0/MarkdStage-win-x64.zip)
- [MarkdStage-win-arm64.zip](https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/releases/download/v3.2.0/MarkdStage-win-arm64.zip)

## Use the CLI

The [MarkdStage CLI](./docs/user-guide/cli.md) runs the same renderer without the canvas, so
Markdown decks also work in terminals, CI jobs, Codex, and Claude Code. It needs Node.js 24 or
later and an installed Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Chromium.

```console
npx @markdstage/markdstage present slides.md
npx @markdstage/markdstage preview slides.md --watch
npx @markdstage/markdstage validate slides.md --json
npx @markdstage/markdstage inspect slides.md
npx @markdstage/markdstage export slides.md --output slides.pdf
npx @markdstage/markdstage export slides.md --output slides.pptx
```

`present` opens the presenter dashboard; select **Start presentation** there
to open the synchronized audience window.

`preview --watch` starts in viewing mode and enables the pencil placement editor
and detailed Architecture designer; saves update the matching Markdown fence
atomically. `preview` without `--watch` is read-only.

`markdstage skill install --target codex` and `--target claude` write portable Agent Skills that
are generated from the same guide topics as the canvas `markdstage_guide` tool.

## Community macOS app

[MarkStageForMac](https://github.com/07JP27/MarkStageForMac) is a native macOS app built by the
MarkdStage community.

## Markdown format

```markdown
---
title: Sample
theme: dark
layout: title
---

# Markdown, ready for the stage.

---

## Second slide

- Use standard Markdown
- Write code and Mermaid directly
```

The leading front matter supplies shared deck settings. Per-slide front matter can override values
such as `layout`, `size`, and `theme`. Put speaker notes in a top-level HTML comment on each slide;
they appear in presenter view and are exported as readable plain text in the corresponding
PowerPoint notes pane. They remain absent from regular slides, the audience window, and PDF output.

## Repository structure

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/extensions/markdstage/` | Canvas Extension, renderer, bundled open-source software, and schemas |
| `.github/skills/markdstage/SKILL.md` | Skill that formats Markdown into slide fragments and opens MarkdStage |
| `packages/markdstage-cli/` | `@markdstage/markdstage` CLI package and portable Agent Skill generation |
| `apps/MarkdStage.Desktop/` | WinUI 3 desktop app |
| `assets/brand/` | MarkdStage logo, lockup, and README banner |
| `assets/readme/` | Rendered slide and Architecture Editor images used in this README |
| `site/` | Bilingual GitHub Pages website, content, and source-backed examples |
| `slides.md` | Sample deck that demonstrates the features |

## Website development

The [website](https://runceel.github.io/markdstage/en/) is generated from `site/` using
Node.js 24 or later, with no build dependencies:

```console
npm run preview:site
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/markdstage/` for Japanese or append `en/` for English.
Restart the command after editing the source. `npm run build:site` produces only
the public files in `_site/`; set `SITE_URL` to the full deployment base URL when
building for another host. `PORT` changes the local preview port.

Edit both `site/content/ja.json` and `site/content/en.json` together. Shared links,
the CLI command, and the trusted Canvas release tag live in
`site/content/product.json`. The examples in `site/examples/` match their PNGs
in `site/assets/examples/`; after editing an example, regenerate its first slide
with the [CLI's `capture --pages 1` command](./docs/user-guide/cli.md) and replace
the matching PNG. The Architecture Editor image is reused from `assets/readme/`.

`npm run test:site` uses the existing Node, Playwright, and axe-core test tools
(install test dependencies with `npm ci` and Chromium with
`npx playwright install chromium` if needed).
The **GitHub Pages** workflow checks pull requests without deploying. Once
changes reach `main`, it publishes the checked `_site/` artifact; it can also
be run manually against `main`. Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its source.
The workflow reads the existing Pages URL and does not change custom domains,
DNS, or HTTPS settings.

## Breaking changes in v2.0.0

The MarkdStage migration does not provide compatibility aliases for the former brand.

| Previous | New |
| --- | --- |
| canvas ID `presentation` | canvas ID `MarkdStage` |
| tool `presentation_guide` | tool `markdstage_guide` |
| `.github/extensions/presentation/` | `.github/extensions/markdstage/` |
| `.github/skills/presentation/` | `.github/skills/markdstage/` |
| `Presentation-win-*.zip` | `MarkdStage-win-*.zip` |

Existing Markdown syntax, themes, Architecture DSL, and action contracts such as `load_deck` and
`goto_slide` remain unchanged.
