// Rendering-cost budget for the Architecture DSL.
//
// Why measure this: layout (layered / row / column) and routing (rip-up and reroute) can easily
// become nonlinear in the number of elements; routing already has a rerouting loop. If this turns
// quadratic or exponential, the browser freezes whenever the slide changes. Nothing looks broken,
// so visual regression tests cannot detect this type of degradation.
//
// What to measure: duration per `renderArchitectureBlock` call (parsing + layout + routing + SVG
// generation). End-to-end time including navigation and font loading varies too much with the
// machine and network to serve as a budget, so call only the pipeline directly **inside the page**.
//
// Budget basis (measured on Windows / Chromium; median of 41 runs):
//
//   | Diagram shape                          | Elements | Per run |
//   | -------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
//   | 1 node (nearly empty)                  |        1 |  0.1 ms |
//   | 25 nodes (no connections)              |       25 |  1.2 ms |
//   | 200 nodes (no connections)             |      200 |  8.3 ms |
//   | 100 nodes + 100 crossing connectors    |      200 |  9.0 ms |
//
// 200 elements is `MAX_ELEMENTS`, the **largest diagram accepted by the DSL**. About 9 ms is
// therefore the measured worst case possible in the product.
//
// Use the **median**, not the mean. Measuring each run individually and taking the median keeps one
// GC pause or other process from moving the result. With a mean, one outlier distorts the ratio and
// encourages weakening the budget until it is meaningless.
//
// For scaling, measure the two sizes **alternately**. Measuring separate batches puts any CPU
// frequency or JIT drift directly into the ratio (the same code was observed varying from 25 ms to
// 111 ms). Alternating applies such drift equally to both sizes, removing it from the ratio.
//
// Why use both checks:
//   - The absolute budget (`RENDER_BUDGET_MS`) is a coarse gate that only catches milliseconds
//     becoming seconds. Shared CI runners vary by several times the measured value; tightening this
//     gate would only make it flaky, not catch degradation.
//   - The **scaling check** catches shape degradation by measuring the cost increase for 8x as many
//     elements. As a relative value, it is unaffected by machine speed and can remain strict even
//     on slow runners.
