# MarkdStage skill

Create all small Markdown slide fragments at presentation startup and pass them
together in the `slides` field of the canvas `open` input. The first slide is
therefore visible immediately, without a "deck not loaded" placeholder.
After registration, navigation is handled entirely by the canvas controls,
keyboard, and Surface Pen on supported systems. Do not run an `ask_user`
navigation loop. Call `load_deck` only when content or theme changes during a
presentation. Omit open input only to refocus an existing instance. Every
non-empty open input must contain `slides`; `sourceName` is metadata and never
reads or watches the named Markdown file.

## Distribution and installation

This file is an optional skill. The presentation runtime is the extension in
`.github/extensions/markdstage/`, which must be installed first. To install it
from the public repository at user scope, ask Copilot:

> Install the MarkdStage canvas Extension from
> `https://github.com/runceel/markdstage/tree/main/.github/extensions/markdstage`
> at user scope.

For reproducible installation, replace `main` with a release tag such as
`v1.0.0` or a verified commit SHA. The extension executes local code, so review
the diff and tag before installation. Put this skill at
`.github/skills/markdstage/SKILL.md` in a project or copy it to the user's skill
scope. See the repository README and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` for ZIP
distribution, Gist single-file limits, and split Mermaid assets.

When only the extension is installed, its bundled `markdstage_guide` tool
provides equivalent slide-format, theme, and Architecture DSL guidance.
Retrieve the required topic before authoring Markdown for the MarkdStage canvas.

## Core principles ⚡

1. **Generate only a small Markdown fragment for each slide.** The extension
   handles HTML, CSS, theme, layout, page numbers, and animation through
   `marked`. Never generate a complete HTML document.
2. **Generate the full deck once, when presentation is requested,** and pass it
   through the `slides` field of `open_canvas` input. Use `load_deck` only for
   changes during the presentation. Do not regenerate Markdown on every page.
3. **Leave navigation to the canvas and input devices.** Users navigate with
   **◀ / ▶**, arrow keys, the slide list (**☰**), and the Surface Pen tail
   button on supported Windows systems. Do not use `ask_user` as a page loop.

A slide should be no larger than this:

```markdown
---
deck: Presentation title
kicker: Section name
page: 2
total: 6
---
## Slide heading

- Bullet **one**
- Bullet two
```

Build an array containing every fragment and pass it to `open_canvas`. The
first slide appears as soon as the canvas opens; canvas controls handle the rest.

### AI-generated decks versus canvas import

The extension also lets users import workspace Markdown directly with
**More controls > Open Markdown**. This deterministic split does not involve AI.

- **Use Open Markdown** when the source already uses slide syntax: pages separated
  by `---` after a blank line, with any required front matter. Per-page Slidev
  front matter is supported, and initial file front matter is inherited while
  `layout: title` applies only to slide one. At import time, users choose
  **Keep imported snapshot** (default) or **Update automatically on save**.
  Source-backed decks can switch modes from the toolbar and retain the last
  valid deck if watching fails.
- **Use this skill to build the deck** when source pages are prose-heavy and
  require summarization into headings and bullets, when page division is
  unsuitable, or when the requested theme and layout must be applied.

When a user asks AI to present a file, follow this skill and generate the deck.
Open Markdown is a separate user workflow, not an AI shortcut.

## CLI-assisted authoring workflow

For an immediate request to present Markdown in GitHub Copilot, keep using the
Canvas startup procedure below. Use the MarkdStage CLI when the task also needs
a persistent source-backed authoring loop, terminal or CI validation, fixed
16:9 diagnostics, targeted PNG review, or PDF/PowerPoint output. The CLI uses
the same parser, renderer, themes, Architecture DSL, and output pipeline as the
Canvas.

Run commands with `npx @markdstage/markdstage` or install
`@markdstage/markdstage` globally and use `markdstage`.

### Recommended create-review-deliver loop

1. **Establish the brief.** Identify the source material, audience, objective,
   approximate slide count or duration, theme, required diagrams, and output
   format. Preserve facts and required terminology from the source.
2. **Read only the relevant guidance.** Start with
   `markdstage guide slide-format`, then retrieve `themes`, `custom-themes`, or
   `architecture-dsl` only when the deck needs them.
3. **Create the complete Markdown deck.** Keep Markdown as the single source of
   truth. Separate slides with `---`, use front matter for layouts and themes,
   and never hand-write slide HTML or CSS.
4. **Validate before visual review.** Run
   `markdstage validate slides.md --json` and fix deck, theme, and Architecture
   DSL errors before judging layout.
5. **Use watch mode for live authoring.** Run
   `markdstage preview slides.md --watch`, edit the Markdown, and review the
   reloaded deck without losing the current slide. The browser begins on the
   fixed 16:9 output surface in viewing mode; **Output preview** switches to the
   retained responsive layout, and the pencil control switches to that layout
   while enabling Architecture placement and detailed editing.
6. **Inspect fixed 16:9 output.** Run
   `markdstage inspect slides.md --json`. Use `--slide <n>` after a localized
   change and `--fail-on-issues` in CI or other quality gates.
7. **Capture only what needs visual judgment.** Run
   `markdstage capture slides.md` to capture clipped slides, or use
   `--pages 2,4` for specific pages. Do not capture the whole deck by default;
   structured diagnostics are faster and more precise for fit problems.
8. **Revise and repeat targeted checks.** Update Markdown, re-run validation
   when structure, themes, or diagrams change, then inspect affected pages.
   Repeat until the deck is valid, unclipped, concise, and visually balanced.
9. **Deliver from the same source.** Use
   `markdstage present slides.md` for presenter view,
   `markdstage export slides.md --output slides.pdf` for PDF, or
   `markdstage export slides.md --output slides.pptx` for hybrid editable
   PowerPoint.

Use screenshots to assess balance, spacing, or diagram appearance, not as the
primary way to discover structural or clipping errors. Review every final
export before distribution.

## Processing model

```text
Presentation startup (once)
  AI -> generate an array of small Markdown fragments for all slides
          | open_canvas("MarkdStage", { input: { slides: [...] } })
          v
  The extension stores the deck during open and displays slide one immediately

Navigation (entirely inside the canvas)
  User -> ◀ / ▶, arrow keys, or ☰ slide list
          | canvas posts the index to POST /navigate
          v
  Extension renders the stored fragment with marked, sanitizes it, and applies the theme
          | SSE
          v
  Native canvas iframe updates without agent involvement
```

- Generate and register the complete deck only once; use `load_deck` for
  mid-presentation replacement.
- The extension owns rendering, decoration, page numbers, Mermaid, emoji, and
  navigation UI. No external server or manually started `localhost` port is
  required.
- One deck is displayed at a time and is intended for a single presenter.
- The project-scoped extension lives at `.github/extensions/markdstage/`.

## Main actions

Start by opening the complete deck through `open_canvas` with
`canvasId: "MarkdStage"`. Pass `slides` and optional `index`, `theme`, and
`sourceName` in `input`. `sourceName` must be the source Markdown's
workspace-relative path; it anchors adjacent `assets/`, Markdown-relative
`theme-file` lookup, and the canvas Export PDF control's `<source-name>.pdf` output. It
does not read or watch that file. To refresh after editing Markdown, regenerate
and pass the complete `slides` array or call `load_deck`.

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `load_deck` | Replace or reload the registered deck. Pass `slides`, optional zero-based `index` (default `0`), optional deck theme (`dark`, `light`, `microsoft`, or `custom`; default `dark`), and optional metadata-only `sourceName`. Use only for content or theme changes after startup; `sourceName` never reads or watches Markdown. |
| `goto_slide` | Select a zero-based `index` in the registered deck. Out-of-range values are clamped. Normal navigation does not need this action; use it only for explicit chat requests such as "go to page 3." |
| `show_slide` | Temporarily replace one slide. Use for a one-off display or when no deck is registered, not for normal presentations. The override is included in output snapshots until navigation or deck replacement resumes the registered deck. |
| `get_architecture_errors` | Return Architecture DSL errors for the whole deck or one zero-based `index`. Each error includes `slideIndex`, one-based `page`, `blockIndex`, `architecture`, `code`, and `message`; temporary `show_slide` content is included. |
| `open_presenter` | Open the current deck in a synchronized, movable, resizable 1280×720 Edge / Chrome / Chromium app-mode window. Use browser or OS controls (`F11` on Windows) for full screen. Surface Pen never launches it. |
| `close_presenter` | Close the external presenter window. |
| `inspect_layout` | Check the registered in-memory PDF-equivalent fixed 1280×720 output snapshot before export, including any `show_slide` override. It never reads the source file on disk. It returns clipped pages and pages with Architecture measurements by default, including element bounds, effective font sizes, fitting flags, and diagram scale. Prefer one whole-deck call; serialize targeted calls because output jobs are exclusive. Prefer this action over image analysis. |
| `capture_slides` | Create 1280×720 PNG files only when visual inspection is required. Pass zero-based `indexes`, or omit them to capture only pages found by `inspect_layout`. Optional `outputDirectory` is workspace-relative. The result contains file paths rather than inline image data. |
| `export_pdf` | Export the current deck as a 16:9 PDF. Optional `outputPath` is a workspace-relative `.pdf` path; default is `markdstage.pdf`. Optional `theme` applies only to PDF. The canvas Export PDF control derives a name from `sourceName`. |
| `edit_architecture` | Toggle the lightweight Architecture placement mode for node dragging, keyboard movement, layout detachment, Undo, and Redo. Each operation is saved immediately under the stable placement contract. |
| `reset` | Clear slide and deck state and return to the waiting view. |

`load_deck` and `goto_slide` return `{ ok, version, index, total }`;
`goto_slide` also returns `changed`. For non-scrolling/PDF decks, call
one whole-deck `inspect_layout` after loading or revising slides. If targeted
inspections are necessary, run them serially. Use `capture_slides` only for
pages whose appearance cannot be judged from the layout diagnostics.
`export_pdf` returns `{ ok, path, total, theme, bytes }`. Before PDF export,
reload the complete deck if its source Markdown changed.

### Full Architecture editing

For a source-backed deck, **More controls > Shape editing** opens the separate
`architecture-editor` canvas directly. If a slide has multiple Architecture
blocks, select one from the accessible diagram picker first. Decks without a
source association retain the lightweight placement editor, and agents can
still use `edit_architecture` for that stable placement workflow.

- Users open it through **Shape editing** after importing Markdown with
  **More controls > Open Markdown**.
- Agents open canvas ID `"architecture-editor"` with
  `input: { sourcePath, blockIndex, theme? }`. `sourcePath` is
  workspace-relative and `blockIndex` is zero-based across the Markdown file.
- Changes remain in a draft until the canvas **Save** control or `save` action.
- Context menus on diagram elements, empty space, and the tree support add,
  connect, duplicate, delete, front/back ordering, Undo/Redo, and Save.
  Group menus provide `none`, `row`, `column`, `grid`, and `layered` layouts.
  A child never offers an action that detaches its parent group's layout.
  Nodes, groups, and images added from empty space are centered at the context
  menu position.
- A bounded shape palette adds rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses,
  diamonds, triangles, hexagons, and parallelograms without overflowing the
  toolbar.
- The primary toolbar keeps Undo, Redo, Shape, Save, and More visible while
  secondary add, edit, arrange, view, grid, and reload commands stay under
  **More**.
- Drag blank canvas space with the primary button to pan in both directions.
  Middle-drag and Space-drag remain available. Move and resize gestures show
  live feedback and respect reduced-motion preferences.
- **Elements** and **Properties** are collapsible. Medium windows use nonmodal
  docks; narrow windows use nonblocking overlays. Opening a panel transfers
  focus to its content, and each panel has a local close control.
- Empty blocks show **Add first shape**. Toolbar additions begin near the
  visible canvas center and avoid occupied siblings.
- Keyboard users open the same menu with `Shift+F10` or the Context Menu key,
  move with arrows, open a submenu with `ArrowRight`, return with `ArrowLeft`,
  execute with Enter/Space, and close with Escape.
- Add a standalone image from the toolbar or an empty-space/group menu. The
  inspector's **Select image from assets/** uses the same picker for node icons.
  The picker searches Markdown-adjacent then workspace-root `assets/`.
  Imported SVG / PNG / WebP / JPG / JPEG files of at most 10 MB are copied to
  workspace-root `assets/`. Name collisions become `name-2.ext`. Removing or
  undoing a diagram image never deletes the shared asset file.
- External-change conflicts never overwrite the source. To restart from the
  file, call `reload` with `{ discard: true }`.
- The editor modifies only existing `architecture` blocks; it does not create
  new blocks.
- The dedicated editor is disabled for non-source-backed decks created directly
  by `open` / `load_deck`, because they have no safe write-back target.

These workflows do not alter the Architecture DSL v1 grammar or the stable save
contract of the placement editor.

## Markdown file syntax

A Markdown file represents the complete deck. At the top level, a line containing
only `---` after a blank line separates slides. A leading `---` block is file
front matter, and separators inside fenced code blocks are ignored.

Use only top-level `---` slide separators. Do not invent custom separators such
as `<!-- slide -->`.

Do not put a top-level HTML comment immediately before a separator. End the
comment, leave a blank line, and then write `---`; otherwise the line may not be
recognized as a slide boundary.

To have MarkdStage itself read and split a workspace Markdown file, use **More
controls > Open Markdown**. Do not use `sourceName` as a file-loading mechanism.

## Canvas API `slides` array

For `open_canvas` and `load_deck`, each `slides` array element is exactly one
slide. Read, split, or generate the deck before calling the Canvas API. Do not
pass a complete multi-slide Markdown file as one element and expect its `---`
lines to be split.

Each element contains optional YAML-like front matter delimited by `---`,
followed by GFM-compatible Markdown.

| Key | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `deck` | Deck name in the left footer |
| `kicker` | Small label above the heading |
| `page` | One-based current page; shown only together with `total` |
| `total` | Total page count |
| `title` | Browser-tab title; defaults to `deck` |
| `layout` | `title` for the cover, `section` for a section divider, `backcover` for the back cover, or `center` to vertically center heading and body together. Omit for top-aligned standard slides. |
| `size` | `auto` (default), `normal`, `large`, or `xlarge`. `auto` safely enlarges only spacious standard slides. |
| `theme` | Per-slide override: `dark`, `light`, `microsoft`, or `custom`. An explicit canvas theme has precedence. |
| `theme-file` | CSS custom-property file for `custom`, resolved first beside the source Markdown and then from the workspace root. A sibling `theme.json` loads automatically. |
| `background-image` | Per-slide decorative image, e.g. `/assets/background.png`, overriding all layouts and themes. Never inherited by later slides, including from initial front matter. |
| `logo` | Back-cover text at top left. Overrides the `theme.json` logo; empty hides it. |
| `copyright` | Back-cover copyright text at bottom left. Overrides `theme.json`; empty hides it. |

The `assets/background.png` alias without a leading slash is also accepted.
Background images use the normal lookup: Markdown-adjacent `assets/` before
workspace-root `assets/`, or workspace root only without `sourceName`.
Only `.svg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files up to 2 MiB are accepted;
remote and `data:` URLs are forbidden. Use literal filenames (spaces and percent
signs allowed) with `/` separators. Source paths are not URL-decoded: `%20`
means literal filename text, not a space. Queries, fragments, backslashes, and
`.` / `..` path segments are rejected. Symlinks must stay inside
the assets folder and workspace. Images are centered cover behind content
and logos with existing colors underneath. For custom default/center layouts,
priority is per-slide `background-image` → `layouts.default.background` or
`layouts.center.background` → root `background` → existing background.
Theme entries use `{ image, alt? }` with theme-local `assets/` paths. Title
slides retain `cover.background`; section/back-cover layouts do not inherit the
common image. Only absent settings fall back; invalid values, missing files,
and oversized images are errors. Existing covers and logos are otherwise unchanged.

Use normal Markdown: headings, lists, emphasis, inline and fenced code, block
quotes, tables, links, images, `mermaid`, `architecture`, and emoji. Write raw
Markdown; do not generate HTML or pre-escape it.

Put Slidev / Marp-style speaker notes in a top-level HTML comment at the end of
the slide. Notes support Markdown in the canvas and MarkdStage Desktop presenter
view, and PowerPoint export includes them as readable plain text notes. They do
not appear on standard slides, the external presenter, or PDF.

```markdown
## Demo

- Key point shown on screen

<!--
Explain the **operation sequence** here.
-->
```

The first H1/H2 in a standard slide is fixed in the top title region. Later
headings stay in the body. Cover, section, and back-cover layouts retain their
specialized positioning. Add a language such as `csharp`, `json`, or `diff` to
a code fence for highlight.js syntax coloring.

## `sourceName` role

`sourceName` is workspace-relative metadata used to resolve themes and images
and derive output filenames. It does not read, parse, split, or watch Markdown
content. Passing `sourceName` does not load a deck; every non-empty canvas input
must still contain the complete `slides` array.

To have MarkdStage load a Markdown file, use **More controls > Open Markdown**.

## Themes

Choose `dark`, `light`, `microsoft`, or `custom`. Precedence is:
**explicit canvas `theme` > Markdown front matter > `dark`**.

| Theme | Appearance |
| --- | --- |
| `dark` | Default dark navy background with bright accents |
| `light` | Neutral, bright, white-based theme |
| `microsoft` | Built-in Microsoft / Fluent color preset |
| `custom` | Brand or organizational template defined by CSS custom properties loaded through `themeFile` or `theme-file` |

A custom theme can be a self-contained folder:

```markdown
---
theme: custom
theme-file: themes/brand/theme.css
---
## Brand theme
```

`theme.css` contains declarations such as `--bg: #101820;` only. Selectors and
`url()` are prohibited. Optional cover/background logos and copyright metadata
go in a sibling `theme.json`, with assets under that folder's `assets/`.

Theme lookup tries the source Markdown folder before the workspace root. Always
pass `sourceName` to `open` / `load_deck`. Every theme receives one automatic
`layout: backcover` slide unless the deck already ends with one. Logo and
copyright are shown only when explicitly provided.

### Choosing a theme from the request

- **custom**: explicit brand colors or an internal template.
- **microsoft**: Microsoft, Fluent, Office, or the Microsoft four-color style.
- **light**: bright, light, white-based, or clean.
- **dark**: dark, black-based, cool, or striking.
- **No theme language**: use `dark`.

Ask the user to select among the four themes only when the request is ambiguous
or mixes styles. For a mid-presentation theme change, call `load_deck` with the
same slides and current index plus the new theme.

## Diagrams and images

Use a `mermaid` fence for automatically laid-out flowcharts, sequence diagrams,
class diagrams, pie charts, and related diagrams. Mermaid is bundled and works
offline. Syntax errors render an error while preserving other slide content.

Before writing Architecture DSL, request `markdstage_guide` topic
`architecture-schema`. This compact, schema-derived authoring contract includes
all element fields, conditional placement requirements, and a complete example.
Request `architecture-dsl` when advanced behavior needs explanation; do not infer
missing fields from a different diagram language.

Use an `architecture` fence when positions, dimensions, containers, and overlap
must be stable. Architecture DSL v1 is stable. See
`.github/extensions/markdstage/README.md` and
`.github/extensions/markdstage/schema/architecture-v1.schema.json` for the
complete contract. An empty fence is a valid empty diagram that the Architecture
Editor can populate. Non-empty invalid JSON remains an error.

Groups support `row`, `column`, `grid`, and `layered`; layered direction is
`down` (default) or `right`. Built-in icons are `cloud`, `database`, `api`,
`user`, `server`, `analytics`, `browser`, `mobile`, `network`, `queue`, and
`shield`. Connector ports are `auto`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
Connector labels default to `labelLayer: "front"`; use `"behind"` only for
legacy behind-box placement. Node shapes are `rect`, `rounded-rect`, `ellipse`,
`diamond`, `triangle`, `hexagon`, and `parallelogram`. Omit `style.dash` for a
solid connector, use `"1 5"` for dotted, or use another numeric pattern such as
`"10 6"` for dashed/custom output.

For custom Architecture icons, place SVG / PNG / WebP / JPG / JPEG files in
Markdown-adjacent or workspace-root `assets/` and use
`icon: "assets/foo.svg"` without a leading slash. External URLs, data URIs,
`..`, and non-ASCII filenames are rejected. Standalone images use:

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "map",
  "src": "assets/map.svg",
  "fit": "contain",
  "ariaLabel": "System overview",
  "x": 80,
  "y": 80,
  "width": 720,
  "height": 420
}
```

`fit` is `contain` (default), `cover`, or `stretch`. Images participate in group
layout, z-order, connector endpoints, and orthogonal-routing obstacles.

For standard Markdown images, remote URLs are accepted directly. Local images
use `![Alternative text](/assets/foo.png)`. Lookup tries an `assets/` folder
beside the source Markdown before workspace-root `assets/`.

## Presentation startup procedure

### 1. Identify the source Markdown

Derive the path from the request. If none is specified, use workspace-root
`slides.md`. Ask for a path only when that file does not exist.

### 2. Parse the Markdown into pages

- A line containing only `---` is a slide separator.
- Ignore `---` inside fenced code.
- Treat an initial `---` YAML block as deck configuration, not a slide.
- Convert a leading `<!-- slide-size: large -->` directive into front-matter
  `size: large`; accepted values are `auto`, `normal`, `large`, and `xlarge`.
- Trim pages and discard empty pages.
- Derive each slide-list title from its first heading, or the first 40
  characters of its first non-empty line.
- Derive the deck title from initial front matter `title`, then the first slide
  heading.

### 3. Generate every slide fragment

Generate the complete ordered `slides` array. Fill correct one-based `page` and
`total` values. Carry over a slide-size directive; otherwise omit `size` and
allow canvas auto-sizing. Select the requested theme once for the deck, not in
every slide's front matter. This generation happens only at startup.

### 4. Validate Architecture DSL, then open the complete deck

If any slide contains Architecture DSL, call the standalone `markdstage_validate`
tool with `{ "format": "slides", "slides": [...] }` before first display. Each
entry must be one slide fragment. To check a DSL body alone, use
`{ "format": "dsl", "source": "<JSON text>" }`; do not mix the two formats.

Check `valid`, `complete`, and `truncated`, not merely API `ok`. Use stable codes,
JSON Pointers, and slide/block positions to fix independent errors together.
Suggestions are not automatic repairs: preserve existing values and review
changes to text meaning. Revalidate and save/display the exact same content.
An incomplete report does not certify unexamined semantic or layout stages.
This tool never opens a canvas or changes files, the active page, or save state.
Use `get_architecture_errors` for the already loaded snapshot and
`inspect_layout` separately for visual fit.

Call `open_canvas` once:

- `canvasId`: `"MarkdStage"`
- `instanceId`: `"markdstage"`
- `input`:
  `{ "slides": ["<slide 1>", "<slide 2>"], "index": 0, "theme": "dark", "sourceName": "path/to/slides.md" }`

`index` and `theme` are optional with defaults `0` and `dark`. `sourceName` is
the workspace-relative source path and is required for adjacent assets,
relative theme lookup, and source-based PDF naming. It is metadata only and does
not read or watch the file. No URL, external server, or health check is needed.

To bring an existing canvas to the front without changing it, call
`open_canvas` without `input`. Any non-empty input must contain `slides`; use
`load_deck` instead when replacing the registered snapshot after startup.

### JSON input safety

Canvas input is JSON. Escape double quotes as `\"`, backslashes as `\\`, and
newlines as `\n` inside serialized slide strings. A malformed string often
appears as:

```text
CanvasInputInvalidError: Invalid input for action "load_deck" ... (root): must be object
```

Prefer typographic quotation marks such as `“ ”` where appropriate to avoid
accidental JSON termination. If uncertain, first verify communication with a
one-slide input such as `{ "slides": ["# Test"] }`.

### 5. Leave navigation to the user

- **◀ / ▶**: previous / next.
- **More controls > External window**: open a synchronized 1280×720 external presenter. Move it to the
  desired monitor and use `F11` on Windows if needed.
- **Keyboard**: `Right`, `PageDown`, or Space for next; `Left` or `PageUp` for
  previous; Home/End for first/last; `O` or Escape toggles the slide list.
- **Surface Pen on Windows**: tail single press (`Win+F20`) for next and long
  press (`Win+F18`) for previous. Double press and pen connection/removal do
  not open the presenter.
- **☰**: open the title list and jump to a slide.

Keyboard operation requires iframe focus. Use `goto_slide` only when the user
explicitly asks through chat for a page. Use `load_deck` only to change content
or theme.

### 6. Finish

No special termination is required. Leave the canvas open, or call `reset` to
return it to the waiting view. There is no external process or temporary file
to stop.

## Generating slide fragments

Classify each source page before adding front matter:

- **Slide-like pages** dominated by headings, lists, code, tables, Mermaid, or
  images should retain their body almost unchanged.
- **Prose pages** should be summarized into a concise heading plus bullets.

Put the standard slide's H1/H2 first so the renderer moves it into the fixed
title region. Add `layout: title` to the cover and `layout: section` to an
intermediate chapter-heading-only slide. Keep standard slides concise.

Sizing:

- `auto`: default; safely enlarge spacious standard slides without code, tables,
  images, or Mermaid.
- `normal`: disable enlargement.
- `large`: one step larger.
- `xlarge`: two steps larger.

Explicit front matter has precedence over `<!-- slide-size: ... -->`.

Layout rules:

- Use `layout: title` when the first slide is a cover.
- Use `layout: section` for intermediate chapter dividers containing only an
  H1/H2. Do not add images or icons.
- Preserve any explicit source `layout`.
- Standard slides align heading and body to the top. Use `layout: center` only
  when both should be vertically centered together.
- The extension automatically appends `layout: backcover` for every theme.
  Do not generate it. Treat closing, thanks, Q&A, and contact pages as standard
  slides. Never use the retired `layout: closing`.

### Converting prose to slides

For each prose-heavy page:

- Preserve intent and facts. Do not invent claims, numbers, or proper nouns.
- Create a short heading and approximately three to six concise bullets.
- Use bold sparingly for important terms.
- Keep one source page as one slide whenever possible; summarize rather than
  splitting a long page.
- Reuse an existing heading or derive a short one from the content.
- Preserve the source paragraph's order and argument.

Example:

```markdown
Our team shares progress every Monday. Each member describes last week's work,
this week's plan, and blockers. This helps identify problems early, align the
team, and reduce rework.
```

Becomes:

```markdown
---
deck: Team operations
kicker: Weekly meeting
page: 3
total: 8
---
## Goals of the weekly meeting

- Share progress every **Monday**
- Cover last week, this week, and blockers
- Identify problems early and align the team
- Reduce **rework**

## Troubleshooting

- If `open`, `load_deck`, or `show_slide` returns `(root): must be object`,
  inspect JSON for unescaped `"` or `\`; use typographic quotes or proper JSON
  escapes. Test a minimal one-slide deck before resending the full deck.
- If the canvas does not update, confirm the action returned success. Navigate
  away and back to force redraw, then reopen canvas ID `"MarkdStage"` with
  instance ID `"markdstage"` and no input if necessary. Reopening with only
  `sourceName` or `theme` is invalid and never reloads Markdown.
- If buttons or keys do not work, click the canvas to focus the iframe. Controls
  are intentionally disabled at deck boundaries.
- For `no_deck`, register `slides` with `open` input or `load_deck` first.
- If the extension/action is missing, confirm
  `.github/extensions/markdstage/` exists and reload extensions.
- If a local image is missing, verify an adjacent or workspace-root `assets/`
  file, an `/assets/...` URL, and a correct workspace-relative `sourceName`.
- If a custom theme is missing, verify `theme-file` beside the Markdown or at
  workspace root and verify `sourceName`. The Markdown-adjacent file wins.
- Mermaid errors preserve the rest of the slide. Correct the syntax and reload.
