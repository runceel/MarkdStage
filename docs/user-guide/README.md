# MarkdStage user guide

MarkdStage turns Markdown into presentation-ready slides. The same Markdown deck can be opened in
the GitHub Copilot Canvas Extension, the standalone Windows Desktop app, or the command-line CLI.

## Choose how you want to work

| Surface | Best for | Main capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**Canvas Extension**](canvas-extension.md) | Creating and revising a deck with GitHub Copilot | Markdown import, live refresh, presenter view, Architecture editing, 16:9 validation, and PDF and editable PowerPoint export |
| [**MarkdStage Desktop**](desktop.md) | Presenting on Windows without opening GitHub Copilot | Current/next slide previews, speaker notes, live refresh, slide overview, and a synchronized audience window |
| [**MarkdStage CLI**](cli.md) | Working in a terminal, CI, Codex, or Claude Code | Presenting with live reload, deck validation, 16:9 clipping diagnostics, PNG capture, PDF and editable PowerPoint export, and portable Agent Skills |

All three surfaces support Markdown, syntax-highlighted code, Mermaid, Architecture DSL, local
images, speaker notes, and the built-in dark, light, and Microsoft themes.
