# Troubleshooting

> 日本語版: [日本語](ja/troubleshooting.md)

## The Canvas Extension is unavailable

- Confirm the repository contains `.github/extensions/markdstage/`, or install the extension at
  user scope from a trusted release tag.
- Reopen the project after installation.
- Use canvas ID `MarkdStage` if you are opening it through a direct canvas workflow.

## Desktop cannot initialize the preview

Install or repair Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, then restart MarkdStage Desktop. Also confirm the
user profile can write to its local application data folder.

## The Store-installed CLI is unavailable or opens a browser

Open a new terminal and run `Get-Command markdstage -All`. Check **App execution aliases**
in Windows Settings if the Store alias is missing or disabled. An npm command earlier in the
resolution order opens the browser UI; the Store command opens the native application.
Do not install npm merely to repair the Store alias. See [installation](installation.md).

## Desktop export fails even though slides display correctly

Native viewing uses WebView2; PDF/PowerPoint export also requires installed Edge, Chrome, or
Chromium. Check that browser remote debugging is permitted by organization policy. Read the export
error before retrying; successful native viewing alone does not verify export prerequisites.

## An AI tool cannot find the installed Skill

Use the same workspace in Desktop and the AI tool. **Install skills…** installs workspace files,
not global agent settings. Check that you selected the correct target, and follow the AI tool's
reload instructions. Update the Skill after updating MarkdStage and review any reported conflicts.

## A Markdown file does not appear in the Canvas picker

- Confirm the file ends in `.md` or `.markdown`.
- Confirm it is inside the current workspace.
- In a Git repository, the workspace root is the repository root.

The picker does not allow paths outside the workspace.

## Slides split in the wrong place

- Put a blank line before a `---` separator.
- Keep the separator on its own line.
- Close fenced code blocks correctly.
- Remember that `---` directly below text can be interpreted as a Setext heading.

## A saved file does not update

- In Canvas, confirm **Refresh automatically on save** is active.
- In Desktop, confirm the same file is still selected.
- Fix empty, unreadable, or invalid Markdown. MarkdStage retains the last valid deck and recovers on
  the next valid save.

## Images do not load

- For Markdown, use `/assets/file.png`.
- For Architecture DSL, use `assets/file.png`.
- Put the file in `assets/` beside the Markdown or at the workspace root.
- Do not use `..` to escape the workspace.
- Check capitalization and the file extension.

## A custom theme does not load

- Set `theme: custom` and a relative `theme-file`.
- Put the theme beside the Markdown or at the workspace root.
- Use custom-property declarations only.
- Remove selectors, `@import`, `url()`, JavaScript, and external paths.
- Validate `theme.json`; an invalid metadata file is reported instead of ignored.

## A slide clips in PDF

Select **More controls > Output preview** in Desktop, Canvas, or the npm UI and use the warning to find the affected page.
Shorten or split the content. `layout: center` changes alignment, not available space, and is not a
clipping fix.

## Mermaid or Architecture shows an error

- Check the fenced block name and closing fence.
- Validate Mermaid syntax.
- Validate Architecture JSON, unique element IDs, references, positions, and supported values.
- Keep other slide content visible while correcting the diagram error.

## Architecture changes cannot be saved

- Advanced editing requires a source-backed deck: open it from Desktop's workspace list or
  Canvas's **More controls > Open Markdown**.
- The source must already contain an `architecture` block.
- If the source changed externally, reload it instead of overwriting the newer file.
- Layout-managed children must be released from their group layout before manual movement.

## The audience window does not enter fullscreen

Focus the audience window, then press `F11`. Press `Esc` to return to windowed mode. If another
application intercepts the key, use the operating system's window controls.
