# Diagrams and media

MarkdStage supports Markdown images, Mermaid for automatic layout, and Architecture DSL for stable
placement and routing.

## Use Mermaid for automatic layout

Write a `mermaid` fence:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Write Markdown] --> B[Preview]
    B --> C[Present]
```
````

Mermaid is bundled and works offline. Use it for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams,
state diagrams, requirement diagrams, pie charts, and other automatically arranged diagrams.

Mermaid diagrams pick up the slide's background, border, text, and accent colors automatically, so
they blend into the deck's theme (including custom themes) instead of using one of Mermaid's own
fixed color schemes.

If Mermaid syntax is invalid, the slide shows an error while preserving the rest of the content.

### Editable Mermaid in PowerPoint

PowerPoint export is hybrid. Supported shapes, text, and connectors stay editable.

Unsupported or unsafe content is preserved as the smallest safe image
fallback.

The whole diagram becomes an image only when native and fallback content
cannot be separated safely.

| Diagram | Approximate editable coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Flowchart | Common nodes, subgraphs, connectors, labels, and safely representable styles |
| Sequence | Basic participants and actors, lifelines, messages, notes, activations, and common control frames |
| Class | Class compartments, common relations and markers, multiplicities, notes, and namespaces |
| State | Basic `stateDiagram-v2` states, start/end pseudo-states, labels, and simple transitions |
| ER | Exact `erDiagram` syntax; entities, attributes, relations, labels, and crow's-foot cardinalities |
| Requirement | `requirementDiagram` blocks, supported relations, labels, and markers |
| Packet / tree view | `packet` fields and bit labels; exact `treeView-beta` hierarchy lines and labels |
| Other Mermaid diagrams | Render normally in slides and use image fallback where editable conversion is unavailable |

Coverage is intentionally approximate: editability depends on the structures
and effects in the rendered diagram, not only its Mermaid type.

The exporter follows the rendered SVG rather than rebuilding layout from
source, and does not claim that every valid syntax variant is editable.

See the presentation-ready
[Mermaid support example deck](../examples/mermaid-support.md) for representative
syntax and current coverage.

#### Common export rules

- Geometry and placement come from the rendered SVG, including connector routes,
  text bounds, and marker direction.

- Theme colors, supported styles and alpha, and simple Japanese or multiline text
  are preserved when they can be represented safely as native PowerPoint
  objects.

- Effect-free text and shapes can retain simple 2D rotation in addition to
  translation and uniform scaling.

- Semantic markers such as arrowheads, diamonds, inheritance triangles, crosses,
  start/end states, and crow's-foot terminals are retained when their rendered
  form is supported.

- Complex transforms, effects, HTML, embedded icons or images, and unknown
  geometry use a local image fallback when native conversion would change their
  appearance.

- A local fallback does not consume supported sibling nodes, connectors, labels,
  or control frames. Those siblings remain editable whenever ownership can be
  separated safely.

#### Fallback behavior

- Export never silently drops visible Mermaid content.

- The smallest safe node, label, connector, marker, decoration, or control frame
  is preferred for image fallback.

- The whole diagram is rasterized only when shared effects, transforms,
  compositing, or ownership make local separation unsafe.

- Mermaid types outside the editable set still render in the slide and typically
  export as a diagram image.

- The export report identifies fallback use with its reason and source path.

## Use Architecture DSL for stable placement

Write JSON in an `architecture` fence when element positions, dimensions, containers, or connector
routes must remain stable:

````markdown
```architecture
{
  "version": 1,
  "canvas": { "width": 1200, "height": 500 },
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "id": "client",
      "x": 80,
      "y": 160,
      "width": 260,
      "height": 140,
      "text": "Client",
      "icon": "browser"
    },
    {
      "type": "node",
      "id": "api",
      "x": 700,
      "y": 160,
      "width": 260,
      "height": 140,
      "text": "API",
      "icon": "api"
    },
    {
      "type": "connector",
      "from": "client",
      "to": "api",
      "routing": "orthogonal",
      "label": "HTTPS"
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Nodes support rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, diamond, triangle, hexagon, and parallelogram
shapes. These additive values remain compatible with Architecture DSL v1 and export as native
PowerPoint shapes. Groups support row, column, grid, and layered layouts. Connectors support
straight, orthogonal, and polyline routing.

Connector line patterns use the existing `style.dash` value. Omit it for a solid line, use
`"dash": "1 5"` for a dotted line, or use another numeric pattern such as `"10 6"` for a dashed
line.

## Adjust placement in the Canvas Extension

For a deck created directly in the canvas without a Markdown source association, select
**More controls > Shape editing** to enter the lightweight placement editor. Select an element,
drag it, or use the arrow keys. The editor provides Undo, Redo, and layout release.

Decks created directly in the canvas keep placement changes in canvas state.

Leave edit mode before presenting.

## Use the Advanced Architecture Editor

For Markdown imported with **More controls > Open Markdown**, select
**More controls > Shape editing** to open the dedicated editor directly. If the current slide
contains multiple Architecture blocks, select the diagram from the picker first.

The editor can:

- Add, duplicate, reorder, and delete nodes, groups, images, and connectors
- Change text, shape, icon, position, size, style, ports, routing, and parent group
- Apply or release group layouts
- Select or import assets
- Pan in both directions by dragging blank canvas space
- Collapse Elements and Properties; medium windows keep them as nonmodal docks,
  while narrow windows use nonblocking overlays
- Keep secondary commands in **More** so the canvas remains the primary surface
- Start an empty diagram with **Add first shape**
- Undo and redo draft changes

Changes remain a draft until you select **Save**. If the Markdown changes externally, the editor
does not overwrite it; reload the source and reapply the intended change.

Advanced editing requires a source-backed deck imported through **More controls > Open Markdown**
and an existing `architecture` block. An empty block is valid and can be populated by the editor:

````markdown
```architecture
```
````

## Add images

Standard Markdown images use `/assets/...`:

```markdown
![Accessible description](/assets/system-overview.png)
```

Architecture icons and standalone images omit the leading slash:

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "map",
  "src": "assets/map.svg",
  "fit": "contain",
  "ariaLabel": "Regional system map",
  "x": 80,
  "y": 80,
  "width": 720,
  "height": 420
}
```

Use `contain`, `cover`, or `stretch` for Architecture image fitting. Supported local formats are
SVG, PNG, WebP, JPEG, and JPG.
